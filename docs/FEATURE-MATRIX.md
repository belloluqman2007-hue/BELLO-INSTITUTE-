| 38 | Admin | **Parent portal login — create & link from the UI** — same tab lists every linked parent account with its children, and creates a new one (username, password, display name, phone) | ♻️ `users` + `parent_links` | ♻️ existing `POST /api/students/:id/parent-account` (accepts `student_ids` for multi-child) | ♻️ same Portal access tab | ✅ madrasa_admin + tenant scope (unchanged) | 🆕 portal-accounts, portal-access-ui | ✅ |
| 39 | Admin | **Account creation during admission conversion** — the CONVERT TO STUDENT action now offers optional student/parent logins with editable usernames (defaults: admission number, admission number + `-p`) and one shared password; the confirmation names the created usernames | ♻️ unchanged | ♻️ existing `POST /api/admissions/:id/convert` fields `create_student_account`, `create_parent_account`, `student_username`, `parent_username`, `password` | ♻️ `academic-admissions.js` `#convertApplicant` (previously posted `{}`) | ✅ `admissions.approve` (unchanged) | 🆕 portal-accounts | ✅ |
| 40 | Admin | **Portal-account status on the student record** — `GET /api/students/:id` additively reports the student login (username, is_active, created_at) and the linked parent logins with their children | ♻️ reads `users` / `parent_links` only | ♻️ additive fields `portalAccount`, `parentAccounts` — existing fields untouched | ♻️ consumed by the Portal access tab | ✅ existing staff-only rule preserved; never returns password hashes | 🆕 portal-accounts | ✅ |
| 41 | All | **Account creation & login guide** — the complete flow for all five account types, the one-login-page rule, and how Accountant/HR/Receptionist/Librarian staff are TEACHER accounts + permission templates | — | — | 📄 `README.md` | — | 🆕 source-contract tests | ✅ |

## Preservation notes

- The 5 core account roles are unchanged; "staff roles" are **permission bundles** on
  teacher-role accounts (the existing Roles & Permissions system is the source of truth).
- Fee, result, payment, message-delivery and PTM lifecycles are untouched — the portals
  read/write through the existing endpoints.
- Islamic/Western modes: portals theme by the institution category and only offer the
  Qur'an module when the backend reports an Islamic institution (which also 404s the
  endpoint for Western tenants, server-side).
- No duplicate modules: the portals share one shell (`portal.js`) and the admin's design
  system (`dashboard.css`); the PTM booking flow remains the single implementation.
- The account-creation pass added **no** new endpoint, module, modal system or login page.
  The student/parent/admission-conversion APIs already existed and are unchanged; the work
  was the missing UI plus one additive, read-only extension of `GET /api/students/:id`.
- Authorization was **not** relaxed to make the feature work: `POST
  /students/:id/portal-account` and `/parent-account` keep `requireRole("madrasa_admin")`,
  the same rule every other student write endpoint in that router uses. Teachers, students
  and parents get 403; a cross-tenant student id gets 404.

|---|------|---------|---------|-----|----------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 42 | Admin/Teacher | **Professional A4 report sheet engine** — one renderer (classic/modern/compact, auto landscape for wide tables, RTL + Arabic preserved, school branding, watermark, grading legend, next-term dates, signature blocks, "Powered by EduSphere" toggle) used by the staff workspace, bulk generation, both portals and the public result checker | 🆕 `services/report-sheet.js` wrapping the existing grading engine (no duplicate calculations) | ♻️ `GET /results/report-card/:studentId/:termId`, 🆕 `GET /results/report-sheet/:studentId/:termId` | ♻️ Report Cards page ("Report sheet" action) | ♻️ `report_cards.view` + teacher class scope | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 43 | Admin | **Configurable report template** — layout, orientation, brand colour, result columns, CA/Exam labels, section visibility (position, attendance, behaviour, comments, promotion, class stats, photo, next term, legend, reference, watermark, credit line), behaviour categories, signature blocks; professional defaults so a new institution needs no setup; sample-data preview before saving | ♻️ `settings` key `report_template` (no new table) | 🆕 `GET/PUT /results/report-template`, 🆕 `GET /results/report-template/preview` | 🆕 Report Cards → Report template modal (edit + preview) | 🆕 `report_cards.templates` (admin-only by default, audited) | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 44 | Admin/Teacher | **Result completeness check** — subjects assigned to a class vs results actually entered; per student and per class; missing vs awaiting-approval distinguished; visible warning in the UI and **on the printed sheet** so an incomplete report is never presented as final | 🆕 `classCompleteness` (reads existing `class_subjects`/`results`) | 🆕 `GET /results/report-completeness` | 🆕 completeness column + class-wide banner on the Report Cards page | ♻️ `report_cards.view` | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 45 | Admin/Teacher | **Behaviour/conduct ratings** — configurable categories, 1–5 ratings stored on the existing `term_summaries` row (migration 038 adds `behaviour_ratings`), rendered with a rating legend; unrated categories show an honest empty state | ♻️ `term_summaries` + 2 columns | ♻️ `PUT /results/summary/:studentId` accepts `behaviour` | ♻️ Comments modal gains a ratings grid | ♻️ `results.edit` | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 46 | Admin/Teacher | **Bulk class generation** — every student with results in one document, one page each, correct student-to-sheet mapping, ordered by position; batched queries (shared preload + grouped results/attendance) so a class never becomes per-student N+1 lookups | ♻️ same builder, batched | ♻️ `GET /results/report-cards/bulk` (+ `/report-sheets/bulk` alias), audited | 🆕 "All report sheets" action | ♻️ `report_cards.generate` + teacher class scope | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 47 | Admin | **Extended promotion decisions** — the engine's four computed statuses are unchanged; an administrator may additionally record promoted-on-trial / withdrawn / completed on the same summary row | ♻️ `term_summaries` | ♻️ `PUT /results/summary/:studentId` | ♻️ Comments modal decision list | ♻️ `results.edit` | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 48 | Student/Parent | **Published-only portal reports** — the student/parent report endpoints now enforce `published_at` server-side (previously an unpublished summary rendered in the portal); portal result listings show published terms only and subject detail excludes non-approved rows | ♻️ unchanged tables | ♻️ `GET /portal/report-card`, `/portal/results`, `/portal/results/:termId` | ♻️ portals (label now "Report sheet") | ✅ publication gate | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 49 | All | **Report reference number** — deterministic, human-facing `EDU-<session>-<class>-<admission>` reference persisted on the summary (migration 038) and printed on the sheet/footer; internal database ids are never exposed | 🆕 `term_summaries.report_reference` | included in sheet payload | printed on the sheet | — | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 50 | All | **Report workflow status + audit** — a report's stage (draft → submitted → under review → approved → published → locked) is derived from its subject results *and* pending entries, shown in the staff preview; report view/print/bulk/template/portal actions are written to the existing activity log | ♻️ existing lifecycle | 🆕 in `report-sheet` payload | 🆕 status pill on the print toolbar | ♻️ existing | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |
| 51 | All | **IDOR fix on the results workspace** — an authenticated STUDENT could read any classmate's full report data through staff endpoints (`/api/results/report-card-data/...` returned 200) because `requireStaffPermission` deliberately passes portal roles through; the results router now refuses student/parent roles outright (they keep their own `/api/portal/*` endpoints) | ♻️ | 🆕 router-level staff gate | — | ✅ | 🆕 report-sheet | ✅ |

### Report-sheet pass preservation notes

- **No duplicate modules**: one report engine (`services/report-sheet.js`) behind every
  printable report; `routes/results.js` keeps its historical exports as thin delegates.
  All totals/grades/averages/positions/promotions still come **only** from
  `services/grading.js`.
- **No second settings system**: the template lives in the existing per-institution
  `settings` store (same pattern as the admissions settings).
- **No second promotion system**: the four computed lifecycle statuses are untouched;
  the extra values are manual annotations on the same summary row.
- **PDF pipeline unchanged**: the platform's documents (ID cards, certificates) render
  HTML and produce PDFs through the browser's print dialog — the report sheet uses the
  same pipeline, which is what preserves Arabic shaping, branding and page breaks.
- **Two pre-existing tests were updated, not weakened**: the portal report-card test now
  asserts an *unpublished* report is refused (403) before asserting the published one
  renders, and the public-checker title regex accepts the new document title in either
  language. Both changes encode the stronger behaviour this pass implements.
